**Hello you all!**
This is a small project to practice a bit with Javascript.
---
## I used it to:
- Improve confidence with Javascript.
- Familiarize with SCSS synthax.
- Familiarize with MarkDown synthax (used to write this ReadMe file).
---
## This repository presents:
- node_modules folder: folder where there is SCSS installation.
- style folder: style.css with style.scss
- home.js file: main Javascript file.
- index.html: main HTML file.
